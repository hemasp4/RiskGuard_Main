# RiskGuard: A Multi-Modal AI-Generated Content Detection System with Blockchain-Backed Evidence Chain

**A Comprehensive Technical Document for Conference Submission**

---

## Abstract

RiskGuard is a production-grade, multi-modal AI-generated content detection platform that identifies synthetic media across four modalities — **image, voice, text, and video** — and preserves forensic evidence on a public blockchain. The system combines lightweight, zero-dependency local signal processing with cloud-based transformer models in a **hybrid CPU + GPU architecture** that runs on commodity 8GB RAM hardware. Evidence integrity is guaranteed through SHA-256 hashing, IPFS decentralised storage, and Merkle-batch anchoring to the Polygon Amoy testnet. A Flutter mobile application serves public users, while a FastAPI-powered web dashboard provides law enforcement investigators with real-time, tamper-proof evidence review capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The proliferation of AI-generated media — deepfake images via Stable Diffusion, cloned voices via XTTS/VITS, AI-authored phishing text via GPT-4 — poses an escalating threat to digital trust, cybercrime investigation, and public safety. Law enforcement agencies face three core challenges:

1. **Detection**: Distinguishing AI-generated content from authentic media across multiple modalities
2. **Evidence Preservation**: Maintaining a tamper-proof chain of custody for digital forensic evidence
3. **Accessibility**: Providing real-time detection tools to both citizens and investigators

### 1.2 Contributions

RiskGuard addresses all three challenges through:

- A **multi-signal ensemble architecture** for each modality that achieves 60–92% accuracy without requiring GPU hardware on the detection path
- A **blockchain evidence ledger** (Nimirdhu Nill Threat Ledger) that anchors batches of evidence to a public chain using Merkle trees, minimising gas costs
- A **dual-interface design**: a Flutter mobile app for citizen reporting and a FastAPI web dashboard for investigator review with Server-Sent Events for real-time evidence notifications

## 3. AI Detection Methodology

### 3.1 Image Analysis Pipeline (v4.0)

The image detection engine uses a **6-signal type-adaptive weighted ensemble** architecture that classifies images into three types (photo, digital art, screenshot) and dynamically adjusts signal weights accordingly.

#### 3.1.1 Signal Descriptions

| Signal | Weight (Photo) | Weight (Art) | Weight (Screenshot) | Technique |
|--------|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|-----------|
| **ONNX/Colab** | 25% | 10% | 20% | CNN binary classifier (ONNX-exported, served via Colab GPU) |
| **Cloud HF** | 25% | 10% | 15% | HuggingFace models: `umm-maybe/AI-image-detector`, `Organika/sdxl-detector`, `google/vit-base-patch16-224` |
| **NPR** | 15% | 5% | 15% | Noise Print Residual — extracts sensor noise patterns absent in AI images |
| **Wavelet** | 15% | 5% | 25% | Haar wavelet decomposition — measures high-frequency energy distribution anomalies |
| **pHash** | 10% | 5% | 5% | Perceptual hashing — structural regularity detection via DCT hash bit patterns |
| **DCT** | 10% | 65% | 20% | DCT spectral analysis — detects GAN/diffusion frequency-domain fingerprints |

#### 3.1.2 Image Type Classification

A lightweight structural classifier (< 5ms, no ML model) determines image type:

- **Photo**: Natural photographs — high colour count (> 5000 unique), smooth gradients, EXIF metadata
- **Digital Art**: Drawings, clipart, flat illustrations — low colour count, large uniform regions, posterisation
- **Screenshot**: UI captures — sharp edges, rectangular regions, text-heavy content

**Key insight**: Cloud/ONNX models trained on *photos vs AI photos* produce false positives on digital art (outside their training distribution). The type-adaptive weighting suppresses these models for art and elevates DCT spectral analysis instead.

#### 3.1.3 NPR (Noise Print Residual)

Derived from [Cozzolino & Verdoliva, 2020], NPR extracts the camera sensor noise pattern by:

1. Applying a 3×3 median filter to get the "clean" version
2. Computing residual: `noise = original - median_filtered`
3. Measuring noise statistics: variance, block consistency, spectral flatness
4. AI-generated images show unnaturally uniform noise (low variance), while real photos have sensor-specific noise fingerprints

#### 3.1.4 Wavelet Decomposition

Uses Haar wavelets (via matrix multiplication, no `pywt` dependency):

1. Decomposes image into 4 sub-bands: LL (approximation), LH/HL/HV (detail)
2. Measures high-frequency energy ratio: `HF_ratio = (LH + HL + HH) / LL`
3. AI images (especially diffusion) show abnormally smooth high-freq distributions
4. Guard: Digital art has inherently low HF energy — detected by checking `npr_unique_colors < 3000` and suppressing the signal

#### 3.1.5 DCT Spectral Analysis

Discrete Cosine Transform frequency domain analysis:

1. Convert to grayscale → apply 2D DCT
2. Compute radial power spectrum (energy vs frequency radius)
3. Measure spectral decay rate and uniformity
4. GAN images: periodic peaks in AC coefficients
5. Diffusion images: abnormally smooth high-frequency distribution
6. Natural photos: diverse, noisy spectrum with natural 1/f falloff

#### 3.1.6 Ensemble Fusion

```python
_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS = {
    "photo":       {"onnx": 0.25, "cloud": 0.25, "npr": 0.15, "wavelet": 0.15, "phash": 0.10, "dct": 0.10},
    "digital_art": {"onnx": 0.10, "cloud": 0.10, "npr": 0.05, "wavelet": 0.05, "phash": 0.05, "dct": 0.65},
    "screenshot":  {"onnx": 0.20, "cloud": 0.15, "npr": 0.15, "wavelet": 0.25, "phash": 0.05, "dct": 0.20},
}
```

Signals returning `None` (timeout/error) are excluded and their weights redistributed proportionally among active signals.

### 3.2 Voice Analysis Pipeline (v6.0)

The voice detection engine uses a **6-signal hybrid CPU + GPU architecture** with real-time streaming support (0.5s chunks), achieving analysis in < 200ms per chunk.

#### 3.2.1 Signal Descriptions

| Signal | Weight | Technique | Reference |
|--------|:------:|-----------|-----------|
| **LFCC** | 30% | Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients — linear filterbank (not mel) captures vocoder artifacts | ASVspoof 2024 standard |
| **CQT Phase** | 20% | Constant-Q Transform phase coherence — detects neural vocoder phase artifacts invisible in STFT | [Tak et al., 2021] |
| **Modulation** | 20% | Temporal envelope modulation spectrum — human prosody at 3–6 Hz syllable rate vs. TTS regularity | [Schreier & Doain, 2010] |
| **Pitch/F0** | 20% | Autocorrelation-based F0 contour naturalness — pitch variance, smoothness, jitter, shimmer | [Drugman & Alwan, 2011] |
| **Statistical** | 10% | Higher-order amplitude moments — kurtosis, skewness deviation from natural speech distribution | [Sahidullah et al., 2015] |
| **wav2vec2 GPU** | 40%* | wav2vec2-base ASVspoof2019 ONNX classifier served via Colab GPU | [Baevski et al., 2020] |

*\*When Colab GPU is online, fusion weights are: 60% local CPU ensemble + 40% Colab GPU. When offline, 100% local CPU with zero accuracy degradation.*

#### 3.2.2 Audio Preprocessing

1. **Loading**: Handles WAV (all bit depths: 8/16/24/32-bit PCM, float32), stereo→mono conversion, resampling to 16 kHz
2. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: WebRTC VAD with aggressiveness level 2 strips silence and non-speech segments. Energy-based fallback if WebRTC unavailable.
3. **Speech Ratio**: Fraction of audio containing speech — low ratio (< 0.1) triggers "insufficient speech" early exit

#### 3.2.3 LFCC Signal

Unlike MFCCs which use mel-scale (perceptual) filterbanks, LFCCs use **linear-scale** filterbanks:

1. Compute STFT (frame: 25ms, hop: 10ms, Hamming window)
2. Apply linear-spaced triangular filterbank (20 filters, 0–8000 Hz)
3. Log → DCT → 13 LFCCs
4. Compute Δ and ΔΔ (velocity and acceleration)
5. Statistical features: mean, std, kurtosis of each coefficient
6. Rationale: Neural vocoders (HiFi-GAN, WaveGlow) leave artifacts in linear-frequency bands that mel-scale filterbanks smooth over

#### 3.2.4 CQT Phase Coherence

1. Wavelet-based CQT approximation with 84 bins (7 octaves × 12 bins, 32–4096 Hz)
2. Compute phase spectrum via analytic signal (Hilbert transform)
3. Measure phase derivative variance (PD variance)
4. Neural vocoders produce unnaturally coherent phase patterns; real speech has natural phase randomness

#### 3.2.5 Modulation Spectrum

1. Extract amplitude envelope via RMS (frame: 40ms, hop: 10ms)
2. Compute FFT of envelope → modulation spectrum
3. Measure energy concentration in 3–6 Hz speech band vs. total
4. Human speech: natural prosodic rhythm with energy peak at ~4 Hz
5. TTS: either too regular (fixed rate) or deviant (shifted peak)

#### 3.2.6 Pitch / F0 Analysis

Autocorrelation-based pitch estimation (no external dependencies):

1. Frame audio (40ms windows)
2. Compute normalised autocorrelation within F0 range (80–400 Hz)
3. Extract continuous F0 contour
4. Metrics: pitch variance, smoothness (derivative std), jitter (frame-to-frame variation), voiced/unvoiced ratio
5. AI voices: low variance (monotone), smooth contour (no micro-variations), fewer unvoiced frames

#### 3.2.7 Ensemble Fusion Strategy

```python
# Fusion with optional GPU acceleration
if colab_online:
    final = 0.60 * local_ensemble + 0.40 * colab_score
else:
    final = local_ensemble  # 100% CPU — zero degradation
```

### 3.3 Text Analysis Pipeline (v3.1)

A **4-signal ensemble** combining cloud transformers with local statistical methods and perplexity analysis.

#### 3.3.1 Signal Descriptions

| Signal | Weight | Technique |
|--------|:------:|-----------|
| **DeBERTa** | 45% | `Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-single` — DeBERTa-v3 fine-tuned on ChatGPT outputs |
| **RoBERTa** | 15% | `roberta-large-openai-detector` — with critical short-text dampening |
| **Binoculars** | 20% | Perplexity proxy via unigram + bigram entropy difference (zero-shot, works on all LLMs) |
| **Local Statistical** | 20% | Lexical diversity (TTR), sentence length variance, vocabulary sophistication, punctuation patterns |

#### 3.3.2 Short-Text Dampening (RoBERTa Fix)

**Problem identified**: RoBERTa-large returns 77–83% "AI" probability on short human text (< 200 characters). This bias causes false positives on casual messages.

**Solution**: Length-based dampening factor:

```python
word_count = len(text.split())
if word_count < 30:
    dampening = 0.3 + 0.7 * (word_count / 30)  # 0.3 → 1.0
    ai_score = neutral + (raw_score - neutral) * dampening
```

This reduces RoBERTa's contribution on short text while preserving accuracy on long-form content.

#### 3.3.3 Binoculars Perplexity Proxy

Inspired by [Hans et al., 2024] "Spotting LLMs With Binoculars":

1. Compute word-level unigram entropy (character distribution complexity)
2. Compute bigram entropy (transition predictability)
3. Ratio: `binoculars_score = bigram_entropy / unigram_entropy`
4. AI text has lower perplexity (more predictable transitions) → lower ratio

This provides a **zero-shot** signal that works on any LLM without model-specific fine-tuning.

#### 3.3.4 Phishing / Threat Detection

Independent of AI detection, a **rule-based phishing analysis** layer provides:

- URL extraction and suspicious TLD detection
- Urgency keyword matching (e.g., "act now", "verify immediately")
- Financial manipulation pattern detection
- Impersonation indicator identification
- Risk score (0–100) with explanation

---

### 3.4 Video Analysis Pipeline (v3)

A **2-signal temporal-aware pipeline** that reuses the full image detection engine per-frame.

#### 3.4.1 Architecture

| Signal | Weight | Technique |
|--------|:------:|-----------|
| **Per-Frame Image** | 60% | Full 6-signal image pipeline on sampled frames (3 FPS, max 30 frames) |
| **Temporal Coherence** | 40% | Optical flow consistency between consecutive frames |

#### 3.4.2 Frame Extraction

- Extracts frames at 3 FPS using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture)
- Maximum 30 frames analysed per video
- Every other frame is analysed (speed optimisation)

#### 3.4.3 Temporal Coherence (Optical Flow)

1. Compute Farneback dense optical flow between consecutive frames
2. Measure flow magnitude variance across the video
3. Deepfakes show **abrupt flow variance** (face swaps cause temporal discontinuities)
4. Real video shows **smooth, consistent** optical flow
5. Inconsistency score mapped to 0–1 AI probability

#### 3.4.4 Fusion

```python
final = 0.60 * mean(frame_scores) + 0.40 * temporal_score
# Patterns reported: flickering (flow spikes), warping (high mean flow), etc.
```

---

### 3.5 Risk Scoring Engine

A **weighted multi-component aggregation** that combines all detection modalities into a unified risk assessment.

| Component | Weight | Source |
|-----------|:------:|--------|
| Call Pattern | 25% | Incoming call metadata analysis |
| Voice Analysis | 30% | Voice deepfake detection probability |
| Content Analysis | 30% | Text/image AI-generation probability |
| History | 15% | User interaction history patterns |

Risk levels: **LOW** (≤30), **MEDIUM** (31–70), **HIGH** (71–100)

## 4. Blockchain Evidence System (Nimirdhu Nill Threat Ledger)

### 4.1 Design Philosophy

The evidence system follows the **"Immutable Chain of Custody"** principle: when a citizen reports suspected AI-generated content, the system creates a cryptographic proof trail that cannot be tampered with, enabling law enforcement to use the evidence in legal proceedings.

### 4.2 Evidence Pipeline

```
User Reports Threat (Flutter App)
         │
         ▼
   ① SHA-256 Hash ──────── Fingerprints the evidence file
         │
         ▼
   ② IPFS Upload ─────────  Decentralised storage via Pinata
         │                   CID returned (content-addressed)
         ▼
   ③ SQLite Record ────────  Off-chain metadata + hash + CID
         │
         ▼
   ④ Merkle Batch ─────────  N evidence hashes → Merkle tree
         │                   Only root is stored on-chain
         ▼
   ⑤ Polygon TX ───────────  storeBatchRoot(merkle_root, N)
         │                   One TX anchors entire batch
         ▼
   ⑥ Verification ─────────  Recompute proof, compare to on-chain root
```

### 4.3 Merkle-Batch Anchoring

**Problem**: Writing each evidence record as a separate blockchain transaction is prohibitively expensive (≈ 50,000 gas × $0.01 = $0.50 per record).

**Solution**: Batch multiple evidence records into a single Merkle tree and store only the root hash on-chain.

#### 4.3.1 Merkle Tree Construction

```python
def _hash_leaf(hex_hash: str) -> bytes:
    return hashlib.sha256(bytes.fromhex(hex_hash)).digest()

def _hash_pair(left: bytes, right: bytes) -> bytes:
    combined = left + right if left <= right else right + left  # Canonical ordering
    return hashlib.sha256(combined).digest()
```

- Leaves are sorted before hashing to ensure canonical ordering
- Single-leaf trees are supported (root = hash of single leaf)
- Proofs contain `{hash, position}` pairs for path reconstruction

#### 4.3.2 Verification Algorithm

For any evidence record with `file_hash` and `merkle_proof`:

1. Compute `leaf = SHA256(file_hash)`
2. For each proof step: combine with sibling hash (canonical order) → SHA256
3. Final result must equal the on-chain Merkle root
4. If roots match → **evidence is provably part of the anchored batch**

### 4.4 Smart Contract (EvidenceAnchor.sol)

Deployed on **Polygon Amoy Testnet**:

```solidity
contract EvidenceAnchor {
    struct Batch {
        bytes32 merkleRoot;
        uint256 timestamp;
        uint256 batchSize;
        address reporter;
    }

    uint256 public batchCount;
    mapping(uint256 => Batch) public batches;

    function storeBatchRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot, uint256 batchSize) external {
        batchCount++;
        batches[batchCount] = Batch(merkleRoot, block.timestamp, batchSize, msg.sender);
        emit BatchAnchored(batchCount, merkleRoot, batchSize, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

### 4.5 IPFS Integration

- **Provider**: Pinata (free tier: 500 files, 100MB)
- **Gateway**: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/{CID}`
- File CIDs are content-addressed — identical files always produce identical CIDs
- Evidence files are immutable once pinned

### 4.6 Gas Cost Analysis

| Approach | Cost per Record | Records per TX |
|----------|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Individual TX | ~50,000 gas | 1 |
| Merkle Batch (10) | ~120,000 gas | 10 |
| Merkle Batch (100) | ~120,000 gas | 100 |

Merkle batching reduces per-record cost by **83% (10 records)** to **99.7% (100 records)**.

## 8. Limitations & Future Work

### 8.1 Current Limitations

1. **Accuracy ceiling**: Without fine-tuned local models, accuracy is bounded by statistical signal quality (~60–70% baseline)
2. **Cloud dependency**: Cloud models (HF API, Colab) have latency and availability constraints
3. **Video scalability**: Per-frame analysis is computationally expensive for long videos
4. **Gas costs**: While Merkle batching reduces costs significantly, Polygon Amoy testnet tokens have no real value

### 8.2 Planned Improvements

1. **Fine-tuned local models**: Deploy quantised wav2vec2 + ViT models locally via ONNX Runtime
2. **Adversarial robustness**: Test against adversarial attacks (e.g., perturbation-based evasion)
3. **Cross-modal fusion**: Combine image + text + voice signals for multi-modal documents (e.g., deepfake video with AI-narrated script)
4. **Mainnet deployment**: Migrate from Polygon Amoy testnet to Polygon mainnet or zkEVM
5. **Model retraining**: Continuously update detection models as new generative AI techniques emerge
